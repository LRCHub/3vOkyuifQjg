Mm, mm
Yeah (Yeah)
Mm (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah
Still put my address in like
I don't know where I stay
She know my phone number,
but how she think
I'm Mike Jones?
Why I had to put it down
in the ice age?
Where I'm from,
you come through late,
you don't do that alone
You brought that face
out the boondocks,
how long did that take?
With your dog,
she can't go left,
be with 'em right or wrong
Everybody 'round me top five,
come to my space (Space)
Everybody high like sci-fi up
in my space (Space)
When we disconnect the wi-fi
(Ah)
Up the hill, it's over drastic
I hope you gassed it,
I'm over-gassed you crashed it
The last one elastic,
tried to find real in plastic
Them other hoes is mass thick
Way you rock the classics,
classic, bomb, bombastic (Bomb)
The setup for the dynasty is
looking dynastic
You know the Don nasty
The Mudboys nasty,
you know the Jack nasty,
you know the- (Know the)
You know that Fay' nasty,
you know the CHASE
(Know the CHASE)
You know the CHASE nasty,
you know my place (Place)
My place is like the afties,
that's word to Niel
(Word to Niel)
I'm a knight off in the night,
ain't got it new (Nah)
One night with me, was the tea,
but don't you spill (Ah)
Throw that body fake, baby,
keep it real
If he hit, don't give him none
like the church
And come to my player's club,
I'm dolla- (Yeah, yeah)
Still put my address in like
I don't know where I stay
She know my phone number,
but how she think
I'm Mike Jones?
Why I had to put it down
in the ice age?
Where I'm from,

Everybody 'round me top five,
come to my space (Space)
Everybody high like sci-fi up

When we disconnect the wi-fi
In the 713, I'm fazed
I say, can I get you up for? Hey
Can I get you up in the city?
My curly hair, baby curly hair
We throwin' it good, okay,
keep throwin' the air
(Throwin' the air)
Throwin' it back, okay,
you're doin' your best
Swing to the hook
when you need some help
Handle bars,
she on my handle bars
She like the finer things
and all my candy cars
Throwin' it back, okay,
you're doin' your best
(Doin' your-)
Swing to the hook
when you need some help
(Need some)
I'm in the Continental,
got her dancin'
Sippin' pineapple, bitch candy
(Yup)
Quarter million dollars,
got 'em fancy (Yeah)
Two hundred on the dash,
don't chance it
Gotta leave the song on,
it's your song, babe
H-Town, hold it down, yeah,
you goin' crazy
See you in the bay, bae,
you know you in here faded
Know you in here faded
Know you in here faded
