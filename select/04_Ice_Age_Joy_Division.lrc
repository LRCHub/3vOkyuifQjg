[00:15.92] I've seen the real atrocities
[00:18.54] Buried in the sand
[00:21.26] Stockpiled safety for a few
[00:22.27] While we stand holding hands
[00:36.27] 
[00:30.69] I'm living in the ice age
[00:35.59] I'm living in the ice age
[00:39.83] Nothing will hold, nothing will fit
[00:42.32] Into the cold, it's not an eclipse
[00:44.78] Living in the ice age
[00:47.28] Living in the ice age
[00:48.20] Living in the ice age
[00:58.70] 
[00:50.90] Searching for another way
[01:07.66] See them hide behind the door
[01:10.13] Live in holes and disused shafts
[01:12.66] Hopes for little more
[01:23.16] 
[01:19.62] I'm living in the ice age
[01:24.65] I'm living in the ice age
[01:28.95] Nothing will hold, nothing will fit
[01:31.38] Into the cold, no smile on your lips
[01:33.87] Living in the ice age
[01:36.16] Living in the ice age
[01:37.17] Living in the ice age
[01:47.67] 
[02:05.46] Living in the ice age
[02:06.92] Living in the ice age
[02:10.21] Living in the ice age
[02:12.65] Living in the ice age
